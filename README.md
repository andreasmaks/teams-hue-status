## üîÑ Auto-start on macOS with launchAgents
To run the script automatically in the background on macOS, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a LaunchAgent
1. Open a terminal and create the LaunchAgent directory (if it doesn't exist):
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
   ```
2. Create a new plist file:
   ```sh
   nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.meetinglight.hue.plist
   ```
3. Add the following content to the file:
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
       <key>Label</key>
       <string>com.meetinglight.hue</string>
       <key>ProgramArguments</key>
       <array>
           <string>/bin/bash</string>
           <string>/path/to/hue-meeting.sh</string>
       </array>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
       <key>KeepAlive</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   </plist>
   ```
   *(Replace `/path/to/hue-meeting.sh` with the actual path to your script.)*

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Load the LaunchAgent
Run the following command to load and start the script automatically:
```sh
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.meetinglight.hue.plist
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Unload the LaunchAgent (if needed)
If you want to stop the script from running automatically, unload the LaunchAgent:
